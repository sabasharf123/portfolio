Today, we created our first circuit that woudld light up an LED light. We learned about jumper wires, ,resistors, and other electronic parts terms such as a push-botton. A resistor helps reduce current flows, and ensures that the circuit won't blow up. We used the resistor and the jumper wires to light up the LED light. It was fun and challening, and I cannot wait to do more!
