hi
<p>My name is Saba! Nice to meet you.I am 16 years old and I go to Lynbrook High School in San Jose, CA.</p>

 My hobbies include playing basketball (go warriors!), reading, coding, and spending time with my family and friends.
My favorite singer is Taylor Swift.
<p>She's so talented and inspiring.</p>
